'Oh Clara...you never said any of this. So why when I ride the trains do I hear it in your voice?'

Houellebecq Girl was filmed in 2017, but is set in the Spring of 2016; before the triumph of trollocracy and the harambisation of the EU. A time when an English man could fall in love with a French woman, and a French woman could not fall in love with an English man, she without thinking he must be a fascist and he without suspecting she was about to become one.

The unnamed and unseen hero of Houellebecq Girl (played by Jack Dunleavy) is a terminal Francophile, though he doesn't speak French. He is obsessed with all things France: history, music, cinema, landscapes, accents and above all women.

By day he works with David (Dan Bassett), a teenager with behavioural problems who is more interested in getting in fights and writing his porn alphabet than doing his homework. By nights, he longs for Clara (Anouk Scheepens, MargauxSad. Adam Loft); French, beguiling and utterly uninterested.

Like David, our hero is a dreamer, more interested in harambising his non-relationship with Clara than facing up to it's lack of substance. Through a cloud of cannabis smoke, on the rails of the London overground, circling high with the falcons above London City hospital, our hero searches for Clara...the version of her that does not exist...on a quest to cheat failure by supplanting the drabness of history with a memory gilded in Francophilia.

Houellebecq Girl is a film about being given lemons and perceiving oranges. Largely filmed on location and in iPhone 4, making wide use of amateur actors and robots, this debut feature from directors Dunleavy and Dodgson is a tender exploration of infatuation and the byways of the human heart. A paean to all that is designated French, Houellebecq Girl is an instant classic destined to be the film of the summer every summer.
