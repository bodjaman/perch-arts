[<< Reality Runs Away](/projects/reality-runs-away)<br/>
**Cyrus Hung** – _Thoughts on Pigeons._ [2019, 10'15"]<br/>
**Tabitha Steinberg** – _I'm wondering if you had any interest in art?_ [2019, 20'00"]<br/>
**Jing Xie** – _Lady, Escalator and Hand._ [2019, 3'23"]

The films selected engage in distinct ways with cinema's relation with public space and the social, as well as art's place in a society. Cyrus Hung's film _Thoughts on Pigeons_ addresses the position of moving-image in art institutions, before musings on cannibalism and surveillance. The film foregrounds cinema's indexical foundations while occupying a liminal space between documentation and performative reading. Tabitha Steinberg's film follow Andrew and Narotam Horn as they sell reproduction oil paintings door-to-door on industrial estates across the UK. The film portrays a fading, precarious way of life and the relationship between a father and his son. Jing Xie's _Lady, Escalator and Hand_ is a video document of a performance in ostensibly public space, presented here as a document of a singular action or event which nonetheless serves as a potential study of social mores, boundaries and cultural exchange in contemporary British life.
