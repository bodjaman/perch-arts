[<< Reality Runs Away](/projects/reality-runs-away)<br/>
**Cyrus Hung** – _Thoughts on Pigeons._ [2019, 10'15"]<br/>
**Tabitha Steinberg** – _I was wondering if you had any interest in art?_ [2017, 20'00"]<br/>
**Jing Xie** – _Lady, Escalator and Hand._ [2019, 3'23"]

The films selected engage in distinct ways with cinema's relation with public space and the social, as well as art's place in a society. Cyrus Hung's film _Thoughts on Pigeons_ addresses the position of moving-image in art institutions, before musings on cannibalism and surveillance. The film foregrounds cinema's indexical foundations while occupying a liminal space between documentation and performative reading. Tabitha Steinberg's film follow Andrew and Narotam Horn as they sell reproduction oil paintings door-to-door on industrial estates across the UK. The film portrays a fading, precarious way of life and the relationship between a father and his son. Jing Xie's _Lady, Escalator and Hand_ is a video document of a performance in ostensibly public space, presented here as a document of a singular action or event which nonetheless serves as a potential study of social mores, boundaries and cultural exchange in contemporary British life.

Jing Xie is a Chinese artist who currently lives and works in Glasgow and Shanghai. She focusing on the relevant research and practice of performativity to continually explore the relationship with others, engaging with performance, intervention, moving image, devising theater and mixed media. Xie’s practice is presenting the self, individuality and identity in different relationships through constructing different situations and actions, reconsidering individuality, subjectivity, subject behaviors and their relationship with social conventions within established political and social contexts, looking into their possibilities of reconstruction and becoming. Her recent work presents reflections on the various crises that human beings face, experimenting with her own individual experience in different networks and contexts, to affected in common experience and broader social connections.
