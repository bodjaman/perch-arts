14, 21, 28 November 2019. 7:30PM – 9:30PM

Reception 7:30PM; screenings 8:00PM – 8:30PM; discussion 8:30PM – 9:00PM.

Reality Runs Away will include films by emerging artists whose work asks questions of the documentary genre, while addressing subjects ranging from migration and memory to labour and language. Artists presenting their work include: Cyrus Hung, Rowan Ings, Kadeem Oak, Anastasia Perahia, Will Pham, Bella Riza, Jessie Russell-Donn, Tabitha Steinberg, Wilma Stone and Jing Xie.

Each screening will be free and open to the public, preceded by a drinks reception and followed by a discussion with the artists and a Q&A session.

The films selected include both documentaries and experiments in cinema, which together ask questions of the conventions of documentary: interviews, archives, testimonies and more. The title, ‘Reality Runs Away,’ is taken from an interview with French filmmaker Georges Franju, whose work, in which he discusses the problem of reality in filmmaking. This programme therefore intends to explore the tensions between reality and fiction in cinema and begins to draw out the limits of documentary as a language, style or genre.

A text accompanying the programme will be distributed at screenings and published online; we also hope to make recordings of the discussions available online.
