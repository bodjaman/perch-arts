Cavadoras is a performance collective based between Berlin and Naples committed to the study of instant composition, poetry, sound and communicating the imaginative potential of the underground.

![Cavadoras, Half Way Down](/img/projects/cavadoras-1.jpg)

 In 'Eine halbe Treppe Tiefer'/ 'Half Way Down' two dancers, a performance poet and a musician use handheld torches in an otherwise dark space. In this game of light and darkness they expose different spaces and degrees of intimacy while the musician modulates a self-built device that translates light frequencies into sound. Inside the oscillating landscape, the collective body’s task is to communicate the urgency of physical poetry making.

Martina Gambardella (dancer, choreographer, IT); Lilly Pöhlmann (dancer ECU/GER); Marcelo Schmittner (sound/light artist CHL); Marianne Tuckman (performance poet/dancer UK)

Doors: 19:00
