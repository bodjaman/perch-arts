Perch Arts is a project co-founded in 2018 by Ois√≠n Davies and Bod Jaman, focused on presenting time-based arts and media, including moving image, performance and sound-based practices. The project is currently based at the Ringcross Community Centre, an operational community centre in Holloway, north London which is managed by The Pilion Trust.

[The Pilion Trust](http://piliontrust.info/ "The Pilion Trust") is a grassroots registered charity, running a range of programmes supporting marginalised groups including young homeless people, refugees & asylum seekers, transgender and intersex people and domestic violence survivors.
