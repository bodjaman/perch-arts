<strong>Rowan Ings</strong> - <em>Never Actually Lost.</em> [2019, 12&rsquo;55&rdquo;]<br/>
<strong>Will Pham</strong> – <em>An Viet (Well Settled).</em> [2018, 19&rsquo;20&rdquo;]<br/>
<strong>Bella Riza</strong> – <em>Salt House.</em> [2017, 12&rsquo;39&rdquo;]<br/>
<strong>Wilma Stone</strong> – <em>A Good Stain.</em> [2016, 5&rsquo;56&rdquo;] <em>The Good Kind.</em> [2018, 4&rsquo;44&rdquo;]</p>

<p>The films selected have coalesced around themes of family and memory, while engaging with conventions of documentary cinema – primarily the interview and archival footage. Rowan Ings presents a documentary about memory and loss, centred around an interview the artist conducted with a family member suffering from dementia. Will Pham&rsquo;s <em>An Viet (Well Settled)</em> is an exploration of the history and current state of a the An Viet Foundation in Hackney, a now closed-down community centre which had served Vietnamese refugees for 35 years. Bella Riza&rsquo;s <em>Salt House</em> &lsquo;offers an intimate glimpse of my father Alper as he returns to his home and native Cyprus. Having left during the war in 1968, it is through re-visiting the island and cooking the dishes from his childhood that he is able to reconnect to his past, and talk openly about memory, identity and migration.&rsquo; Wilma Stone will present two films. <em>A Good Stain</em> is an experiment in moving-image set to a recording of psychic and medium Katie Orr. <em>The Good Kind</em> is a work in which the artist explores her recently discovered gypsy ancestry, using this journey to critique the mass-mediation of marginalised groups.</p>

<p><a href="https://bellariza.com/" target="blank">Bella Riza</a> is an artist and filmmaker based in London. In 2017 she completed her Masters at the Royal College of Art where she specialised in Moving Image and received the Chris Garnham Prize. Her work explores memory, personal histories and composition in relation to the idea of home.</p>

<p>Her film Salt House (2017) has been selected for Bloomberg New Contemporaries (2018) and screened at the Tate St Ives, South London Gallery and the Liverpool Biennial.</p>

<p>Wilma Stone is a trans-disciplinary artist. She makes her work by any means necessary, producing diverse artworks ranging from ceramic sculptures to performance works, to artist films. She has co-authored a book on streetwear, co-produced a feature-length documentary, and worked in the art, film and fashion worlds for the past twenty years.
Through the language of paradox and the intensification of affective energy, Stone manipulates sound and moving image in an attempt to articulate the irreconcilable. Her recent work utilises the nomadic circulation of virtual images, montage-clashing them alongside her own and collapsing the binary distinctions of fiction and documentary. Creating unpredictable objects, she refutes trauma-derived narratives that render marginalised subjects genetically inferior, deviant, and other. Her aim - to holla truth into the silence of everyday atrocities.</p>
